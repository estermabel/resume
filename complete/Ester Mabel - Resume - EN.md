# üßë‚Äçüíª¬†Work Experience

## Flutter Developer

**CatSkillet**, Brazil - (Dec 2020 - Present)

Working at CatSkillet as a Flutter developer has made me grow a lot as a developer and learn a lot about Flutter. In my time there, I worked on 2 projects: [Tismoo.me](http://tismoo.me/) and [ASP](https://www.asp.com). In both projects, Clean Code teachings were applied and Scrum was used as an agile development methodology.

In the [Tismoo.me](http://tismoo.me/) project I was part of the development team. I was responsible for developing screens following a design prepared by the design team, making integrations with the API, doing maintenance and refactoring code and features. I was also responsible for migrating the entire application to Dark Mode. The application was developed with BloC as state manager and initially with MVC architecture, later migrating to MVP architecture.

In the [ASP](https://www.asp.com) project, I'm also part of the development team. The project is currently at the beginning of its development. However, for its construction, it is making use of Modular as architecture and BloC as state manager.

## CEO | Flutter Developer

**Is It Safe?**, Brazil - (Jun 2021 - Present)

In June 2021 I created the [Is It Safe?](https://isitsafe.com.br) project. An app made with Flutter and SpringBoot aimed at the LGBTQIA+ community. I did all the elaboration and ideation of the project, starting its development in July 2021.

The application, with Flutter, is being developed with BloC as state manager and MVP (Model - View - Presenter) architecture. Within the project, I have acted primarily as CEO and Flutter developer. As a developer, I've been integrating with our API in development, developing the layout and doing code review, and managing tasks.

My other roles within the project consist of managing all of our teams that are part of the project, besides the development teams, and taking on other administrative and leadership roles.

## Project Manager | Flutter Developer

**CalmExperts**, Canada - (Feb 2021 - Mar 2021)

Working at CalmExperts brought a very rich experience. During my time working there, I started as a Flutter developer, working on 2 projects: Buffet and Finance. In the Buffet project, I made use of the Google Maps library for Flutter to be able to manipulate/manage places on the map, besides styling it.

After a few weeks, I was given my own project to manage. So with the position of project manager, I started to manage and develop the Finance project. The project was developed with Flutter Web, using BloC as a state manager and MVC architecture.

With Finance, I had the opportunity to work on my leadership skills, being responsible for a complete Back-end and Front-end team. I did the distribution of tasks, code review and was in direct contact with the customer to better capture their vision for the project and make the necessary changes to meet them.

## Flutter Developer

**Ache Im√≥veis**, Brazil - (Oct 2020 - Jan 2021)

As a Flutter developer in the [Ache Im√≥veis](https://apps.apple.com/bb/app/ache-im√≥veis/id1569269939#?platform=iphone) application, I was part of the development team. I was responsible for creating and designing the entire user interface (UI) of the application and the user experience (UX) of the application. Besides being responsible for developing screens, flows, and features with Flutter.

With Flutter, it was necessary to consume data from an API, developed with SpringBoot. Dio package was used to capture the API data.

## TI Internship

**Sicoob Cooperbom**, Brazil - (Aug 2020 - Dec 2020)

IT intern responsible for developing WEB systems using PHP, using CodeIgnitor framework along with HTML/CSS/JS with Bootstrap. The systems in question were mostly aimed at the administration and internal use of employees.

I was also responsible for creating, manipulating, and administering tables in the database, using the MySQL database language. The development was mainly using the MVC architecture. Another role I played during my time working at Sicoob was technical support.

## Programming Logic Monitor

**Universidade Cat√≥lica do Salvador**, Brazil - (Aun 2019 - Mar 2020)

As a university student and marathon runner in state and national programming competitions. I opened two monitoring classes, the first one aimed at helping with Programming Logic and Algorithms using the Java programming language. The second class was focused on competitive programming with C++. In both classes, the theoretical part was taught and monitoring in the practical part, in the resolution of exercises and simulations of competitions.
